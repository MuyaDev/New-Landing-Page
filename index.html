          <u>About Muya</u>
        </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>Muya completed his University in 2010,with a major in Economics,but quickly lost his passion for Ecoonomics and without
        direction quickly descended into a reckless interest for Marketing.The irreversible damage caused by the deplorable
        obsession was only a gateway to further irresponsible acts.He pursued another degree in Marketing leading to engagements
        with Airtel,Tiger Brand and GlaxoSmithkline.</p>
      <p> In the end,Muya found himself caught up in a web design and computer programming cult. Under the influence of the cult
        his love for Economics was completely lost.</p>
      <p>Programming teaches you a systematic way of thinking that will help you in executing your job. As the saying goes,
        computers are very smart but also very dumb.Being able to conceptualize my clients needs was my main motivation to
        take programming classes as I continue in my Marketing career.</p>
      <p>I'm an Urbanite. Foodie. Explorer. Aspiring paraglider Intrigued by design, traveling, photography, classical music,
        strategy, writing, art, armchair philosophy, fabulous food, and even better conversations. Seeking to be inspired,
        to envision the unlikely, to work hard for things that are worth it, and to be surrounded by those who bring out
        the best in me.</p>
